        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li> 
          <li>Variables are named containers that allows us to store data in our code and also referred to as identifiers.</li> 
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Variables in JS are declared with keywords var, const or let.</li> 
          <li>Declaring a variable outside of a function, it is called a global variable, while declaring a variable within a function is known as a local variable.</li> 
          <li>There are 7 primitive data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, BigInt, String and Symbol.</li> 
          <li>JS is a dynamically types language meaning you don't have to specify the data type of the variable when you declare it as they are automatically converted during script execution.</li> 
          <li>Literals represent fixed values in JS. There are Array, Boolean, Numeric, Object, RegExp and String literals.</li> 
          <li>A For Loop contains 3 important statements: a strting point, a condition and an iteration statement. Finally, you include the code to be executed for each loop in curly braces {}.</li> 
          <li>Funtions are a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li> 
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.Random() are both properties of JS's built-in math object that can be used together to generate a random number or output.</li>
